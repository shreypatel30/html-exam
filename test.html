        ENIAC, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, was <i style="color:springgreen;background-color:darkslategrey;">the first general-purpose digital computer</i>. It was created back in the 1940s during World War 2 as a government-funded project at the University of Pennsylvania. John Mauchly, a physicist, and J. Presper Eckert Jr., an engineer, were the leaders of the ENIAC project. Their goal was to create an all-electronic computer that could calculate artillery ranges for the military. Although it was the quickest computer at the time and considered "programmable", actually rewiring the computer to run a new problem took a great deal of time. Because ENIAC used conditional branching just like the British super computer at the time, Colossus, it was extremely flexible in that it could be used for a multitude of problems and equations, even though it was built for a certain purpose. ENIAC was one of the first supercomputers and as such, it was physically gigantic. It took up a space of around 1500 square feet with each section of the computer being 8 feet tall and 2 by 2 feet deep. Consisting of more than 100,000 computer parts, ENIAC was  the most complex electronic device ever built at the time. It always running, producing 174 kilowatts of heat, which required its own personal AC unit. ENIAC was an extremely powerful machine for its time, and it could execute up to 5,000 additions per second, several times quicker than previous electromechanical devices. It and subsequent computers employing vacuum tubes are known as first-generation computers. ENIAC and a host of other primitive computers are called first-generation computers, because they contained vacuum tubes within the build. Its first calculations were used to help create the first hydrogen bomb.</p>

    <p>COBOL - The First Most-Widley Used Computer Language
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/COBOL"><img src="https://mainframedebate.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/screen-shot-2019-09-10-at-14.49.43.png" width=200px></a>

        Common Business-Oriented Language, also known as <a href="https://www.guru99.com/learn-cobol-programming-tutorial.html">COBOL</a>, was <i style="color:white;background-color:fuchsia;">the first widely-used computer language</i> in the world, and it remained extremely popular among the business community. It is common in ATMs, and can be executed on IBM machines and personal computers. Due to the way it is structured, COBOL is perfect for managing large amounts of data because of its advanced file handling capabilities. COBOL was created by an effort between the federal government and the private sector. This division was called Conference on Data Systems Languages, otherwise known as CODASYL. The two main objectives CODASYL hoped to achieve were readability, how easily it could be read like English, and portability, how well it could be transferred and runned from device to device. It was first announced back in 1962 that IBM, International Business Machines, would use COBOL as their primary language for development on all sorts of devices. Since COBOL was so focused around handling and managing tremendous amounts of files, in 1965, COBOL introduced the ability to handle even larger amounts of tables and storage files. The American National Standards Institute acknowledge and approved COBOL to be utilized for wide-spread commerical use. Soon, the world's economy began depending on COBOL to keep it up and running. Insurance comapnies, transportation systems, government agencies, banks, and other financial institutions all began to rely on COBOL as a way to manage data. By 1970, COBOL becomes the most widely-used computer language in the world, being found in many different forms of companies and governments. Today, around 250 billion lines of COBOL are still be used to run the world's economies, and without them, our markets would most certainly crash.</p>
