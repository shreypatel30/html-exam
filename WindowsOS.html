        <li>The operating system of a computer is the software that manages hardware, software resources, and basic
            tasks such as executing commands and controlling external devices such as a keyboard or mouse. Windows OS,
            also known as Microsoft Windows or simply, Windows, is an operating system created to be used on personal
            computers. It was developed by Microsoft Corporations and is, to date, <i>the most popular computer
            operating system in the world. This allowed seamless transition between personal and work computers for
            most users. </i> Windows was extremely popular right off the bat because it contained a graphical user
            interface, GUI, that could be used on almost any type of computer. IBM machines were best suited for
            Microsoftâ€™s operating system back when it was first created in 1985.</li>
    <br>        
        <li>Windows Operating System was
            revolutionary because it allowed users to roam and utilize a virtual desktop, rather than searching for file
            directories and applications through a command prompt. Actual windows of content, applications, or files
            could now be opened at the click of a button. As Microsoft developed their operating system and released
            more and more versions that were up to date, the functionality and ability of the OS increased. A dedicated
            file manager, program manager, print manager, and even an internet browser later on were all added to the
            operating system. As more functionality was added, the user interface also become more dynamic and able to
            manage loads even better. Up until 2001, Microsoft had multiple packages of their OS. With Windows XP, they
            combined all of these packages into one, fully developed operating system. Successors of Windows XP, in
            order, are Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and the current version of Windows 10. </li>
