        <li>The integrated circuit, more commonly known as the computer chip or simply, chip, is a small square made out
            of semiconductor material, usually silicon, that hosts a set of other electronic circuits. The integrated
            circuit contains millions or even billions of tiny electrical devices that make up the set of circuits
            residing on the chip itself. Different components of the integrated circuit include diodes, capacitors,
            resistors, and transistors. In modern computers, integrated circuits make up the processing and memory
            power, like the CPU, or central processing unit, for example. These computer chips must be built and
            assembled in completely clean rooms because even a small contamination can make the whole chip defective and
            unable to perform.</li>
    <br>        
        <li>Every one to two years, engineers and researchers are able to make new chips that are
            even more powerful than the last. This is due to the fact that the transistor and other circuit components
            get smaller and smaller with time. Starting with only a couple thousand on the integrated circuit in 1971,
            we are now able to put over a billion transistor components on our computer chips. The amount on the
            integrated circuit doubles about every 18 months, allowing us to make faster and faster CPUs and other
            computer parts. The effort to make the integrated circuits as small as possible is not a new concept. In
            1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation came up with a
            method of reducing the overall size of the circuit. They use small strips of aluminum or copper as wires to
            transmit electric currents between components on the integrated circuit. <i>The creation of the integrated
            circuit was major milestone in the history of computers; ICs made the technological advancements of our
            time possible.</i></li>
