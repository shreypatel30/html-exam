        <li>Common Business-Oriented Language, also known as <a href="https://www.guru99.com/learn-cobol-programming-tutorial.html">
            COBOL</a>, was <i>the first
            widely-used computer language</i> in the world, and it remained extremely popular among the business
            community. It is common in ATMs, and can be executed on IBM machines and personal computers. Due to the way
            it is structured, COBOL is perfect for managing large amounts of data because of its advanced file handling
            capabilities. COBOL was created by an effort between the federal government and the private sector. This
            division was called Conference on Data Systems Languages, otherwise known as CODASYL. The two main
            objectives CODASYL hoped to achieve were readability, how easily it could be read like English, and
            portability, how well it could be transferred and runned from device to device.</li>
    <br>    
        <li>It was first announced back
            in 1962 that IBM, International Business Machines, would use COBOL as their primary language for development
            on all sorts of devices. Since COBOL was so focused around handling and managing tremendous amounts of
            files, in 1965, COBOL introduced the ability to handle even larger amounts of tables and storage files. The
            American National Standards Institute acknowledge and approved COBOL to be utilized for wide-spread
            commerical use. Soon, the world's economy began depending on COBOL to keep it up and running. Insurance
            companies, transportation systems, government agencies, banks, and other financial institutions all began to
            rely on COBOL as a way to manage data. By 1970, COBOL becomes the most widely-used computer language in the
            world, being found in many different forms of companies and governments. Today, around 250 billion lines of
            COBOL are still be used to run the world's economies, and without them, our markets would most certainly
            crash.</li>
