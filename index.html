        <li>ENIAC, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, was <i>the first general-purpose digital
                computer</i>. It was created back in the 1940s during World War 2 as a government-funded project at the
            University of Pennsylvania. John Mauchly, a physicist, and J. Presper Eckert Jr., an engineer, were the
            leaders of the ENIAC
            project. Their goal was to create an all-electronic computer that could calculate artillery ranges for the
            military. Although it was the quickest computer at the time and considered "programmable", actually rewiring
            the
            computer to run a new problem took a great deal of time. Because ENIAC used conditional branching just like
            the
            British super computer at the time, Colossus, it was extremely flexible in that it could be used for a
            multitude
            of problems and equations, even though it was built for a certain purpose.</li>
    <br>    
        <li>ENIAC was one of the first
            supercomputers and as such, it was physically gigantic. It took up a space of around 1500 square feet with
            each
            section of the computer being 8 feet tall and 2 by 2 feet deep. Consisting of more than 100,000 computer
            parts,
            ENIAC was the most complex electronic device ever built at the time. It always running, producing 174
            kilowatts
            of heat, which required its own personal AC unit. ENIAC was an extremely powerful machine for its time, and
            it
            could execute up to 5,000 additions per second, several times quicker than previous electromechanical
            devices.
            It and subsequent computers employing vacuum tubes are known as first-generation computers. ENIAC and a host
            of
            other primitive computers are called first-generation computers, because they contained vacuum tubes within
            the
            build. Its first calculations were used to help create the first hydrogen bomb.</li>

        <li>The transistor is an electronic device made for amplifying, controlling, and generating electric signals. A
            transistor typically has 3 prongs, which serve as terminals for a connection between it and another circuit.
            They are able to turn on and off incoming currents and can do so several billions of times a second. They
            are usually constructed out of semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium. <i>The transistor is an
            important advancement in the progression of computers because they sought to replace the mechanical relays
            and bulky vacuum tubes of the first computers</i>. These first computers were so large in part, because
            they contained these massive vacuum tubes. The transistor removed the bulk and trimmed “excess fat” allowing
            computers to be much smaller than they previously were. The transistor is the primary reason we can have
            portable size computers, rather than an entire room filled with one.</li>
    <br>        
        <li>In 1947, John Bardeen, Walter H,
            Brattain, and William B. Shockley invented the device at AT&T’s Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. The
            transistor was much more efficient than the vacuum tubes because they not only were smaller, but they
            generated less heat, consumed lower power, and were much more reliable than the tubes inside the first
            computers. The composition of the transistor continued to be refined, until engineers had discovered
            semiconductor elements and compounds worked best for controlling electric currents. Eventually, in the 1960s
            and 70s, transistors were combined with integrated circuits which made the chips quicker and able to handle
            more tasks than previously possible.</li>

        <li>Common Business-Oriented Language, also known as <a href="https://www.guru99.com/learn-cobol-programming-tutorial.html">
            COBOL</a>, was <i>the first
            widely-used computer language</i> in the world, and it remained extremely popular among the business
            community. It is common in ATMs, and can be executed on IBM machines and personal computers. Due to the way
            it is structured, COBOL is perfect for managing large amounts of data because of its advanced file handling
            capabilities. COBOL was created by an effort between the federal government and the private sector. This
            division was called Conference on Data Systems Languages, otherwise known as CODASYL. The two main
            objectives CODASYL hoped to achieve were readability, how easily it could be read like English, and
            portability, how well it could be transferred and runned from device to device.</li>
    <br>    
        <li>It was first announced back
            in 1962 that IBM, International Business Machines, would use COBOL as their primary language for development
            on all sorts of devices. Since COBOL was so focused around handling and managing tremendous amounts of
            files, in 1965, COBOL introduced the ability to handle even larger amounts of tables and storage files. The
            American National Standards Institute acknowledge and approved COBOL to be utilized for wide-spread
            commerical use. Soon, the world's economy began depending on COBOL to keep it up and running. Insurance
            companies, transportation systems, government agencies, banks, and other financial institutions all began to
            rely on COBOL as a way to manage data. By 1970, COBOL becomes the most widely-used computer language in the
            world, being found in many different forms of companies and governments. Today, around 250 billion lines of
            COBOL are still be used to run the world's economies, and without them, our markets would most certainly
            crash.</li>

        <li>The integrated circuit, more commonly known as the computer chip or simply, chip, is a small square made out
            of semiconductor material, usually silicon, that hosts a set of other electronic circuits. The integrated
            circuit contains millions or even billions of tiny electrical devices that make up the set of circuits
            residing on the chip itself. Different components of the integrated circuit include diodes, capacitors,
            resistors, and transistors. In modern computers, integrated circuits make up the processing and memory
            power, like the CPU, or central processing unit, for example. These computer chips must be built and
            assembled in completely clean rooms because even a small contamination can make the whole chip defective and
            unable to perform.</li>
    <br>        
        <li>Every one to two years, engineers and researchers are able to make new chips that are
            even more powerful than the last. This is due to the fact that the transistor and other circuit components
            get smaller and smaller with time. Starting with only a couple thousand on the integrated circuit in 1971,
            we are now able to put over a billion transistor components on our computer chips. The amount on the
            integrated circuit doubles about every 18 months, allowing us to make faster and faster CPUs and other
            computer parts. The effort to make the integrated circuits as small as possible is not a new concept. In
            1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation came up with a
            method of reducing the overall size of the circuit. They use small strips of aluminum or copper as wires to
            transmit electric currents between components on the integrated circuit. <i>The creation of the integrated
            circuit was major milestone in the history of computers; ICs made the technological advancements of our
            time possible.</i></li>

        <li>The operating system of a computer is the software that manages hardware, software resources, and basic
            tasks such as executing commands and controlling external devices such as a keyboard or mouse. Windows OS,
            also known as Microsoft Windows or simply, Windows, is an operating system created to be used on personal
            computers. It was developed by Microsoft Corporations and is, to date, <i>the most popular computer
            operating system in the world. This allowed seamless transition between personal and work computers for
            most users. </i> Windows was extremely popular right off the bat because it contained a graphical user
            interface, GUI, that could be used on almost any type of computer. IBM machines were best suited for
            Microsoft’s operating system back when it was first created in 1985.</li>
    <br>        
        <li>Windows Operating System was
            revolutionary because it allowed users to roam and utilize a virtual desktop, rather than searching for file
            directories and applications through a command prompt. Actual windows of content, applications, or files
            could now be opened at the click of a button. As Microsoft developed their operating system and released
            more and more versions that were up to date, the functionality and ability of the OS increased. A dedicated
            file manager, program manager, print manager, and even an internet browser later on were all added to the
            operating system. As more functionality was added, the user interface also become more dynamic and able to
            manage loads even better. Up until 2001, Microsoft had multiple packages of their OS. With Windows XP, they
            combined all of these packages into one, fully developed operating system. Successors of Windows XP, in
            order, are Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and the current version of Windows 10. </li>
