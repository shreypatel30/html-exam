        <li>ENIAC, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, was <i>the first general-purpose digital
            computer</i>. It was created back in the 1940s during World War 2 as a government-funded project at the
            University of Pennsylvania. John Mauchly, a physicist, and J. Presper Eckert Jr., an engineer, were the
            leaders of the ENIAC project. Their goal was to create an all-electronic computer that could calculate artillery
            ranges for the military. Although it was the quickest computer at the time and considered "programmable", actually
            rewiring the computer to run a new problem took a great deal of time. Because ENIAC used conditional branching just
            like the British super computer at the time, Colossus, it was extremely flexible in that it could be used for amultitude
            of problems and equations, even though it was built for a certain purpose.</li>
    <br>    
        <li>ENIAC was one of the first supercomputers and as such, it was physically gigantic. It took up a space of around
            1500 square feet with each section of the computer being 8 feet tall and 2 by 2 feet deep. Consisting of more than
            100,000 computer parts, ENIAC was the most complex electronic device ever built at the time. It always running,
            producing 174 kilowatts of heat, which required its own personal AC unit. ENIAC was an extremely powerful machine
            for its time, and it could execute up to 5,000 additions per second, several times quicker than previous electromechanical
            devices. It and subsequent computers employing vacuum tubes are known as first-generation computers. ENIAC and a host of
            other primitive computers are called first-generation computers, because they contained vacuum tubes within the
            build. Its first calculations were used to help create the first hydrogen bomb.</li>
